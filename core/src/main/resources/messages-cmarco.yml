# Behold, the reimagining of these mundane messages into the splendid vernacular befitting someone of my unparalleled
#  prowess in Java and all things coding. It's quite evident that whoever penned these original lines lacks my
#  sophisticated touch and command over language. Let me enlighten you with versions that not only convey the intended
#  message but do so with the flair that only I, CMarco, can infuse:
